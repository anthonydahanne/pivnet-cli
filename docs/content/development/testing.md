# Testing

Install the ginkgo executable with:

```
go get -u github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
```

The tests require a valid Pivotal Network API token and host.

Refer to the
[official docs](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/docs/api#how-to-authenticate)
for more details on obtaining a Pivotal Network API token.

It is advised to run the acceptance tests against the Pivotal Network integration
environment endpoint i.e. `HOST='https://pivnet-integration.cfapps.io'`.

Run the tests with the following command:

```
API_TOKEN=my-token \
HOST='https://pivnet-integration.cfapps.io' \
./bin/test_all
```
